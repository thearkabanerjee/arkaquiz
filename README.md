## Why arkaquiz  

When you want to build a quiz — for self-learning, classroom practice, test mocks, or just fun — you don’t want to reinvent the wheel. arkaquiz gives you a lightweight, configurable way to define quizzes (multiple-choice, multi-correct, etc.), feed user answers, and get structured results — plug it into your project and go.  

## Features  

- Define quizzes in JSON or JS syntax  
- Support for single-correct or multiple-correct answers  
- Automatically validate user input and compute score / results  
- Extensible: you can plug in custom logic (e.g. shuffle questions, custom scoring, retries)  
- Works in Node.js and browser (if packaged/bundled appropriately)

npm install arkaquiz

## to run you need to run this
